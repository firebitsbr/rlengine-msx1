RetroDeluxe Game Engine for MSX1 computers

RLE is a game engine targeted at MSX1 Computers, written in C and aimed at
making the development as easy as possible.

At the moment it provides:

* Build System support for 32K, 48K and up to 2048K ROMS
* Automatic compilation of assets (Maps, Tiles, Sprites)
* Low level HAL libraries (VDP, PSG, System)
* High Level Helpers for Sprite and Tile Animation
* Different modes of compression for Map and Tile Data (RLE, Block)
* Basic Physics and Animation Support

RLE is a work in progress, and although it still lacks a music player, is mature
enough for development (see the tests folder for samples).
